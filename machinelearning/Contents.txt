- formating data (Data Cleaning)
	- dropped lastorder_platform
	- Unnamed
	- 7 days
	- Identifying null or missing values: 
		- (-1) values list
		- comparison of sum amount spent_30days vs lastuser_usecase categories including the null values

 - feature engineering
	- formatting the dates
	- creating ratio clumns
	- creating interactions per day
	- number of days on the app since registration
		= (max_date - regist_date).days
	- online_ratio 
		- #days interacted/number of days on app 

- What we see (insights/Data Exploration)
	- Hash_userid: 
		- each user has data per month 2022-10 to 2023-01
		- once user is inactive in a month, there is no data for the following month
	- online ratio for active and inactive users
	- High number of registrations during promotions but not equating to revenue/spend on the apps
 	- Users registered in 2023 are marked as inactive on the data file
	- On average, users who have cards binded 
		- spend more than those who dont
		- avg number of days interacted with the app is higher
	- An outlier: A user that is inactive in 2023 spent over R100 000 (probably error on the data)
	- what makes a user to go inactive?

- Model selection
	- sklearn - how to pick a model
	- sklearn - try a few models
- Model Evaluation
	- sklearn for evaluation

-Implementation ideas:
	- Please call me concept: a user can request data from another through the vodapay app.
	- relook at redesigning the app to be more user friendly
	- advertise at partner stores with discounts
	- come up with specific adverts for specific benefits
	- reward long term users
	- investigate adding streamlined apps 
		- (remove apps users has not used for a certain amount of time but can still search them)
	- as soon as user installs and registers on vodapay - disable/migrate the My Vodacom App profile
